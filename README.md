## Note I am only responsible for the section of Back-end.  
### I used PHP language with Laravel framework. Laravel gives me many tools such as Controllers, Migration, Model, Mail class and built-in functions.

This project is a site where we offer more than one service to help people with color blindness and eye diseases such as cataracts, in addition to some doctors' diagnoses.    
One of the most important services provided by the project
1- Diagnosis of eye diseases: through which the patient uploads an image of the fundus of the right or left eye to see if he has cataracts or not.    
2- Recognizing colors using a video camera: the patient can, when he needs to know any color, open the camera, through which he can know the color and determine its degrees    
3- Color blindness test: Through it, the doctor and the patient can know the percentage of the patient's infection with the disease      
4- Book an appointment with the doctor: Through it, the patient can make an appointment with the doctor he wants, and his data can be recorded in case he needs to register again.      
5- Identifying colors by entering a picture: Through it, the patient can upload any picture to know the shades of colors in it, which facilitates his dealings         
6- A chatbot: helps site visitors to know information about their diseases, and the most important measures to be taken to reduce the severity of the disease.       
Among the most important features of this site:     
1_ Help people with color blindness view colors quickly and easily instead of waiting for people to help them        
2_ It helps the patient to know the diagnosis of the disease quickly and accurately instead of going to the doctor and waiting for long periods to get the result. These results will serve as a starting point for work on this site, its development and the addition of more services.
